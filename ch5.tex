%Chapter 5: Offshore Data and Tsunami Modeling

\chapter{Offshore Data and Tsunami Modeling}

The rapid estimation of realistic tsunami models along the coast immediately adjacent to large earthquakes (the â``near-field'' or ``near-source'' region) continues to be a pressing problem for tsunami warning, as the number of people and infrastructure located in areas of tsunami hazard grows \citep{basher2006}. Tsunamigenic earthquakes in the last decade have had catastrophic consequences with a large loss of life and impact on the built and natural environments. Most notably the 2004 Mw 9.2 Sumatra-Andaman event \citep{ammon2005,ishii2005,lay2005,stein2005,subarya2006} resulted in over 250,000 casualties, the majority of them on the nearby Sumatra mainland, with run-up heights of up to 30m \citep{paris2007}. The Mw 8.8 2010 Maule earthquake in Chile \citep{lay2010,delouis2010} resulted in 124 tsunami related fatalities and run-up heights as high as 15-30m in the near-source coast \citep{fritz2011}. The 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake \citep{simons2011,lay2011japan} generated a tsunami with inundation amplitudes as high as 40m  resulting in over 15,000 casualties \citep{mori2012} and was the first case of a large tsunami impinging upon a heavily developed and industrialized coastline in modern times. Tsunami induced damage was heavy on port infrastructure, major roadways and railways were severed, energy generating power stations (in particular, nuclear power) were forced offline for extended periods of time, defense infrastructure was compromised, and telecommunications were impeded as well as destruction of countless homes, offices and other industries. In addition to the tragic loss of life the economic collapse of the near-source coastline, which spans nearly 400km, was almost complete \citep{hayashi2012}. Throughout this chapter we will focus on how the techniques developed in Chapters 3 and 4 to rapidly image the earthquake source can be utilized to forecast tsunami intensity. Furthermore, we will demonstrate that land-based sensors alone provide only limited forecasts and that utilizing ocean-based measurements int he source estimation process greatly improves estimates of the earthquake source as well as tsunami forecasting and modeling.

\section{Background}

Japan possesses the only fully operational tsunami early warning system (TEW) worldwide capable of delivering alerts in the near-source coastline as well as numerous defenses against tsunami attack such as seawalls. The Tohoku-oki event demonstrated that early warning must be complemented with a comprehensive understanding of regional hazards and a prepared response in order to have the greatest impact. It also underscored some significant limitations of existing TEW methods, particularly in the near-field. Currently, operating algorithms to rapidly estimate tsunami intensity can be broadly divided into two classes: (i) those that use rapid estimates of simple earthquake source parameters like epicenter and magnitude, derived from land-based sensors, to guide warning and (ii) those that use direct measurements of sea-surface disturbances from ocean-based sensors to assess the intensity of an event without the need to characterize the earthquake source. The system of the Japanese Meteorological Authority (JMA) \citep{tatehata1997} is of the first kind; rapid determination of magnitude and event location from seismological measurements is used to seed a database query of pre-computed scenarios. These scenarios, determined well in advance of an event, are earthquakes of different magnitudes and locations that are used offline as initial conditions to produce simulations of tsunami propagation and metrics of inundation intensity at points along the Japanese coastline. Thus, when an earthquake strikes, from its rapidly determined magnitude and location the most appropriate scenario is extracted from the database and used to guide the warning. 


During the Tohoku-oki earthquake, early estimates of earthquake magnitude from JMA were too low by 1-2 orders of magnitude; an estimate of Mw 7.2 was determined after 30s and revised to Mw 8.0 by 107s \citep{hoshiba2011}. It took 20 minutes for a reliable estimate of magnitude to be made teleseismically through the W phase method \citep{duputel2011,hayes2011}. Maximum tsunami amplitudes of $\sim$40 m \citep{mori2012} were reached in the Sanriku coast within 30 minutes of rupture initiation. The underestimate of the earthquake size lead to early estimates of wave heights that were too low by several meters to tens of meters \citep{ozaki2011}. These complications in adequate magnitude estimation arise from reliance solely on seismic data to compute source parameters. Weak-motion seismometers, traditionally used for such tasks as monitoring local seismicity or Earth structure studies with teleseismic data, mechanically clip during strong shaking. Strong-motion accelerometers, designed to stay on-scale during periods of intense shaking, but, as demonstrated throughout Chapter 2, are not easily integrated to displacement because of unresolved baseline offsets in the acceleration data \citep{Boore2005}. Numerous schemes have been proposed to correct strong motion data and deal with this difficulty and a few of them show encouraging results and could possibly be automated \citep{Wang2013}. However even when strong motion waveforms are corrected carefully, it remains exceedingly hard to ensure that a corrected record reflects ground motion across the frequency band necessary to adequately characterize large sources. In Chapters 3 and 4 we showed that the long-period band of a record is the most critical to accurate magnitude computation of large events. Yet, in real-time inertial strong motion sensors it remains the most unreliable one, leading to saturation of near-source magnitude computations which result in underestimation of the earthquake size.


The second form of warning relies on direct measurements of sea-surface height disturbances ($\eta$). Most notably used for this purpose are the Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) buoys. They compose a network of ocean bottom pressure sensors installed in deep water (4000-6000m), acoustically relaying pressure information to a buoy equipped with satellite telemetry that communicates with a centralized processing facility \citep{gonzalez2005,mungov2013}. One reason for deploying in deep water is that the propagation of tsunami waves can be considered a linear process while in shallower water the non-linear behavior increases \citep{arcas2012} complicating the analysis of the tsunami source and forecasting. With these deep water measurements a linear inverse problem is solved for the tsunami source by superposition of previously computed unit sources of vertical seafloor displacement. This tsunami source is then used as the initial conditions in propagation of tsunami waves on a nested grid by solving the shallow water equations with numerical dispersion to simulate physical dispersion \citep{titov1997}. Once tsunami propagation has been modeled it is analyzed to generate site-specific warnings \citep{titov2005}. This approach has the advantage that it directly measures the tsunami rather than just rely on estimates of the size of the seismic source. However, bottom-pressure recordings like DART are expensive and sparse and because they are not deployed in the near-source coast provide no warning in the region immediately adjacent to the event. This method of warning has been mostly employed for ocean basin-wide forecasts.


With advances in real-time GPS such as instantaneous relative positioning \citep{bock2000,Bock2004,Larson2003} and precise point positioning \citep{Zumberge1997}, after the 2004 Sumatra event proposals for tsunami warning based on geodetic measurements and earthquake source models more complex than just magnitude and location emerged in the literature. \citep{Blewitt2006} used permanent deformation estimates produced by the earthquake from GPS to grid search a database of possible, pre-computed, earthquake finite fault models. \citep{sobolev2007}proposed and demonstrated the viability of a system that uses coseismic offsets from GPS to directly invert for a heterogeneous slip model. In the intervening period, before the 2011 Tohoku-oki event, the W phase method for computation of centroid moment tensors \citep{kanamori2008} started producing rapid solutions with far-field seismic data routinely \citep{hayes2009}. The  \textit{fast}CMT algorithm discussed in Chapter 3 also demonstrated that CMTs could be computed with coseismic offsets from GPS, without regard for saturation at high magnitudes, a problem often faced by seismic methods. \citep{otoole2012} demonstrated the viability of full waveform CMT inversions from the high-rate real-time GPS data. \citep{singh2012} tested an algorithm for estimation of rapid rectangular source models with uniform slip and \citep{Crowell2012} produced heterogeneous coseismic slip inversions from real-time data for two large events. The pace of research in the field accelerated after the 2011 Tohoku-oki event. \citep{guilhem2013} as well as our own work that extends the \textit{fast}CMT algorithm to a line source are a solution to the problem of violation to the point source assumption often faced with near-field CMT determination of large events. \citep{Ohta2012} were able to produce in simulated real-time mode a simple uniform slip source model for the 2011 Tohoku-oki event; \citep{PerezCampos2013} computed similar models for one scenario and one recorded subduction event in Mexico. \citep{Wright2012} produced source models with 4 fault patches from precise point positioning data. 


Furthermore, we've shown in Chapter 3 that a slip inversion, in simulated real-time mode, for the Tohoku-oki event from improved coseismic offsets by the optimal combination of accelerometer and GPS data is possible. This was achieved through a Kalman filter formulation (Chapter 2). Notably, in Chapter 3 we've shown that the fault plane used for the slip inversion can be determined without operator interaction, a problem not addressed before, by means of a finite-extent line source CMT inversion that bounds the geographic extent of moment release. This is important because a CMT determination allows discernment between thrust, normal and strike-slip events, all of which are possible in a subduction setting, but pose distinct tsunami hazards. This often ignored step is crucial because not all large events in a subduction zone can be assumed to happen on the megathrust. The Mw 8.6 event off Sumatra, Indonesia, on 11 April 2012 \citep{satriano2012} was a predominantly strike-slip event that produced no significant tsunami. Similarly, the Mw 8.1 Samoa event on 29 September 2009 was a normal faulting, outer-rise type event that produced a sizable tsunami with 189 fatalities \citep{okal2010}. More recently the 2012 Mw 7.8 Haida Gwai thrust event offshore British Columbia produced a tsunami and was followed 2 months later by a Mw 7.5 strike-slip event on the fore-arc sliver \citep{lay2013}. Additionally the availability of a finite-extent CMT estimate is crucial to determining the fault plane on which to parameterize the slip inversion. We've argued throughout this work that geodetic and especially seismogeodetic data can rapidly characterize earthquakes of arbitrarily large magnitude and faulting type with minimum assumptions.


This extensive body of research by the community cohesively argues that improved earthquake source models should play an important role in guiding tsunami warning. However, in spite of mentioning that source characterization could aid tsunami warning, before \citet{Ohta2012}, none of the above works gauged the impact of their source models on inundation forecasting. Neither did they propose how to map an earthquake source estimate into a forecast of tsunami intensity. This class of warning, where a tsunami propagation model is initiated from an earthquake source inversion, is often called indirect \citep{arcas2012} because it does not involve measurement of the tsunami itself. \citet{Ohta2012} used their uniform slip source estimates as initial conditions for a tsunami that they propagated using the algorithm of \citet{tsushima2009}, which assumes tsunami Green functions (tGF) from unit sources of vertical sea floor displacement \citep{satake1995}, and compared it with off-shore GPS buoys, bottom pressure sensors and tide gauges with mixed results.


\citet{macinnes2013} tested ten source models obtained from inversion of GPS, far-field seismic and tsunami wave gauge data as initial conditions to model tsunami propagation. When simulation results were compared to DART buoys and post-event field survey measurements \citep{mori2012}, it was found that indeed the diversity of source models produces significant variations in the simulated tsunami. This reiterates a recurring problem in tsunami science; for indirect warning the non-uniqueness of source inversions poses a hurdle. However \citet{macinnes2013} showed that in spite of this, many source models retain the capacity to produce realistic tsunami scenarios. The source inversion techniques analyzed in that study, however, are problematic for real-time implementation. They rely heavily on far-field geophysical data as well as decision-making by the researcher to define the parameterization to be used in the inverse problem. \citet{hoechner2013} also produced tsunami intensity estimates in the near-source coastline from a 30 s sampled GPS-derived static slip inversion; that work however did not asses the accuracy of the inundation model or provide an automated way to determine faulting style, select the slab segment or determine the regularization parameter in the inverse problem.


Additionally, offshore shallow water measurements from coastal tide gauges, GPS buoys and ocean bottom pressure sensors can be used in a linear inverse problem \citep{satake2013} for the earthquake source. Furthermore the joint inversion of both data sets \citep{romano2012,gusman2012} produces a slip pattern significantly different from the land-based static offset inversions only of \citet{hoechner2013} and Chapter 3, albeit with similar seismic moment. This is important because it suggests that indirect warning can then rely on actual measurements of tsunami propagation to improve the earthquake source model.


Follwing we will demonstrate first the improv,nets from static-offset derived models since these are the ones easiest to compute and that necessitate the fewest assumptions. We will employ line-source CMT and finite fault slip models derived from a seismogeodetic analysis of Chapter 3 and tsunami wave gauge data for the 2011 Tohoku-oki event to accurately forecast the tsunami intensity and inundation levels. We will emphasize the need for careful algorithm design to ensure minimal interaction from the network operator and assure that the process can be fully automated. This multi-sensor approach can then be applied as a basis for more timely and effective early warning for residents of the near-source coastline.


\section{Data and Method}

\label{sec:method}

\subsection{Description}

The real-time combination of strong motion and GPS data via a multi-rate Kalman filter produces broadband strong motion displacement waveforms (Chapter 2) that are reliable at all frequencies of seismological interest. These seismogeodetic data, can be used in a real-time environment to obtain high accuracy coseismic offsets and rapidly compute line-source CMT solutions and finite fault slip models as a regularized linear inverse problem (Chapter 3). We use  the same data as before, from 139 collocated GPS and accelerometer station pairs (within 1.5 km) in Japan (Figure \ref{fig_maps}) in the computations for the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake. A finite extent CMT solution is calculated with the fastCMT algorithm to determine type of faulting and geographical extent of rupture, followed by estimation of a finite fault slip model. The regional 3D slab model for the subduction zone is established a priori from \citet{hayes2012}. In a real-time scenario, the relevant segment of the slab is extracted from the regional model based on the moment release of the finite extent CMT. It is then discretized to sub-fault patches and the slip inversion is performed. This approach using the seismogeodetic data yields slip inversions with more shallow slip than the GPS-only inversions due to improved precision in the vertical channel. This distinction is critical, while the algorithm described here can be employed with GPS data alone, the addition of the strong motion data reduces the uncertainty of the vertical component of motion. For the Tohoku-oki case this model is determined at 157s after earthquake origin time and in the timeline of warnings provides the first estimate of the slip distribution.

  \label{fig_maps}
\end{figure}
As time progresses data from coastal and offshore wave gauges begin to accrue and are incrementally ingested into the inversion process. We employ data from 8 coastal tide gauges, 6 off-shore GPS buoys and 2 ocean bottom pressure (OPB) sensors for a total of 16 wave gauges (Table \ref{tb_wave_stations}, Figure \ref{fig_maps}). The data for all stations are resampled at 15 s. To compute the tGFs we calculate the seafloor deformation for 1 m of thrust and 1 m of strike-slip motion at each one of the subfaults. We then compute the resulting tsunami waveform at each one of the 16 wave gauges from this unit amount of slip using the open source GeoClaw software (www.clawpack.org). These time series of sea-surface motion are what we consider the tsunami Green functions for every subfault wave gauge pair.

We ingest the tsunami observation data in 10 minute increments and jointly invert them with the seismogeodetic offsets assigning relative weights of 1 to the tide gauges, 5 to the GPS-buoys and 10 to the ocean bottom pressure sensors \citep{satake2013}. These weights arise from an analysis in Section \ref{sec:linearity} on the linearity of tsunami propagation at the different sensor locations. They are also in line with recent inversion techniques that employ these data \citep{satake2013}. We thus have a source estimate at 157s after rupture initiation from just the seismogeodetic data  and then at 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 minutes from the joint inversion of land- and ocean-based data for a total of 6 models. The segment of the slab where the inversion is performed is that determined from the line source CMT in Chapters 3 and 4 and is held fixed throughout. For automated selection of smoothing in the slip inversions we, once again, employ AkaikeÕs Bayesian Information Criterion. At each instance we compute 200 slip inversions with varying degree of smoothing and select as our preferred model the one with smallest ABIC. The computation of 200 source models takes only a few minutes on a four-core computer and is easily parallelizable since each computation is independent of the others.

For each preferred source model (the one with smallest ABIC) we compute the predicted vertical seafloor deformation and use it as the initial condition for a tsunami simulation. To propagate the tsunami we employ GeoClaw (http://clawpack.org), by which two-dimensional shallow water equations are solved with the finite volume technique \citep{leveque2002}. The code simulates non-linear water wave propagation and can deal with discontinuities in the solution, such as turbulent bore formation, by shock capturing. Furthermore it employs adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) such that regions of larger tsunami complexity are automatically refined to higher discretization levels according to heuristics prescribed by the user. The code is suitable for near shore inundation analysis. It employs a Manning-type law for bottom friction (we held the coefficient fixed at 0.025) and has a moving sea/land boundary condition that allows cells to be wetted or dried as the simulation progresses and has a non-reflecting outflow boundary condition at the edges of the model domain. The algorithms are described in detail in \citet{george2006}, \citet{george2008} and \citet{berger2011}. GeoClaw has been benchmarked by the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP) \citep{gonzalez2011} and approved for use in hazard modeling products. A simulation run takes $\sim$1 hour on the same four-core computer using the standard open source multi-processor platform openMP. Ostensibly for real-time performance the code can be optimized and the run time can be significantly improved by parallelization to a suitable level.

Topography for the simulations is taken from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM3) \citep{farr2007} with a resolution of 3 arcseconds ($\sim$90m pixel size). Off shore bathymetry has a resolution of 30 arcseconds ($\sim$1km pixel size) from the SRTM30+ dataset \citep{becker2009,sandwell2009}, which represents a synthesis of marine soundings and spaceborne altimeter measurements. The vertical datum of both data sets is mean seal level (MSL).
The simulations are run for 120 minutes of model time with output at 15s intervals. The simulation domain is between 34$^\circ$N and 41$^\circ$N and 139$^\circ$E and 146$^\circ$E. From the model output we extract 2 distinct sets of inundation information. First, we collect maximum inundation amplitudes at the coordinates of 2256 quality A and B survey measurements located inside the model domain from \citet{mori2012}. We also collect the inundation amplitude at all points on the coastline (at mean sea level, MSL) as defined by the SRTM3 water body data information. For each point where inundation output is desired we use the finite volume cell whose center is nearest the observation point at any given instant. The distinction between these two types of inundations can be appreciated in Figure \ref{fig_cartoon}. Inundation at the coastline is the maximum amplitude of the tsunami at the water-land boundary as defined before the event and it is equal to the maximum flow depth at that point. The inundation at the survey points is the maximum amplitude of the flow, with respect to the vertical datum defined by MSL. ItÕs inundation at a point that is on land before the event. The inundation amplitudes at the survey points are not the amplitude of the tsunami with regards to the local elevation (the flow depth). The inundation at the survey points is used to verify the predictive power (often referred to in forecasting as the skill of the model) of each simulation. In contrast the predicted inundations at the coastline are what we propose could be used as intensity metric to guide the warning. The simulations also produce wave gauge output at the locations (Figure \ref{fig_maps}) of the ocean bottom pressure sensors, GPS buoys, and tide gauges located along the coast.

\subsection{Linearity in Tsunami Propagation}

\label{sec:linearity}

Underlying the joint inversion procedure is the assumption that tsunami propagation in shallow water (at the locations of the wave gauges) is a linear process. That is, tsunami waves generated by uplift due to slip on distinct subfaults can be linearly superimposed. Recent studies have made this assumption when using these measurements to analyze the earthquake source even at coastal tide gauges \citep{romano2012,gusman2012,satake2013} and indeed the same assumption is made in this study. However, it is well known that the non-linearity of tsunami propagation increases as the wave shoals. That linearity can be invoked for modeling with data from such shallow depths is controversial \citep{arcas2012} and the assumption that it cannot is one of the reasons for deploying DART buoys in deep water \citep{titov2005}. The GeoClaw simulation code solves the non-linear shallow water equations so it is possible to test this assumption, at least numerically, and at the level of precision allowed by the bathymetry and topography we employ here. 
We develop two simple tests of linearity. First we test for homogeneity to ensure that, for a given model, $f(x)$, $f(\alpha x)=\alpha f(x)$ where $\alpha$ is a scalar. We place 1m of thrust slip on a shallow fault patch in the middle of the fault model (patch 10) and simulate the tsunami, we then place 2m of slip on the same patch, simulate the tsunami and compare this output to the result of multiplying the output of the 1 m simulation by 2. The results are in (Figure \ref{fig_linearity1}). The second test is for additivity such that, for two models $f(x)$ and $f(y)$, $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$. We again place 1m of slip on subfault patch 10 and place 1m of slip on a deeper subfault (patch 37). We model the tsunami from simultaneous slip on both patches and compare it to the addition of the output from the independent simulations of each fault patch (Figure \ref{fig_linearity2}). The results of these two tests show that non-linearities exist but that they are small compared to the maximum amplitude of the tsunami at each wave gauge. Also the non-linearities are larger at the tide gauges (which are in shallower water) than at the GPS buoys and OBP sensors. This is the reason for the relative weighting scheme discussed in the previous section. Generally the non-linearities are more pronounced at longer times after the first arrival. We perform similar analysis on different combinations of subfaults with similar results. We conclude that non-linearities exist, are quantifiable but small enough to allow for a joint inversion. Because non-linearities are smallest during the first wavelength of the tsunami the linearity assumption will degrade as longer and longer segments of the wave gauge record are used.

\section{Inversion and Forecast Results}

The results of the inversions at the 6 time intervals are summarized in Figures \ref{fig_results1} and \ref{fig_results2} and Table \ref{tb_results}. Figure \ref{fig_results1} shows the results of the finite fault slip inversion from the land-based data obtained at 157s after earthquake origin time (OT). Peak slip as reported in Chapter 3 for the static case is close to 30m and maximum seafloor uplift is $\sim$6m. The fit to 50min of wave gauge data (Figure \ref{fig_results1}) (not used in the inversion) is poor, with a root mean square (RMS) value of 1.42m. The OBP stations are not well fit and the tsunami amplitude is underestimated; similar results are observed for the buoy measurements indicating that the tsunami is systematically underestimated. This rather smooth slip model, however, fits the coseismic offsets from the seismogeodetic data with a 99\% variance reduction (Table \ref{tb_results}). The joint inversion with the first 10 minutes (Figure \ref{fig_results1}) of wave gauge data shows minimal differences from the inversion using just the land data. The fit to the coseismic offsets is reduced slightly to 98\% variance reduction, and the fit to the 10 min of wave gauge data improves (RMS of 0.26 m). Only the pressure gauges have a significant signal of $\sim$1 m amplitude. The remaining stations have yet to register a significant disturbance. At 20 min (Figure \ref{fig_results1}) significant differences arise. The peak tsunami amplitude has been reached in the OBP records and all GPS buoys register a sizeable signal. As a result, the slip inversion is noticeably altered; it has a peak displacement of $\sim$60 m over a large asperity and peak seafloor uplift is $\sim$20 m. The fit to the wave gauge data is very good (RMS of 0.24m) while the fit to the coseismic offsets is significantly reduced to a variance reduction of 66\%. The magnitude has increased from Mw 8.9 in the previous inversions to 9.1. Between 30min and 50min (Figure \ref{fig_results2}) the inversion stabilizes as the first peaks of the tsunami waveform have been fit at the deeper water (TI and BY) stations (Table \ref{tb_wave_stations}); subsequent changes are a result of fitting the later part of the time series and the lower-weight coastal tide gauge data. Peak slip settles at around 60m on a very shallow patch at 38$^\circ$N and on a deeper patch at 15km depth around 37$^\circ$N; magnitude is Mw 8.98-9.04. The fit to the coseismic offsets over this period oscillates (Table \ref{tb_results}) and settles to 70\% on the last inversion while the fit to the wave gauges remains stable at ~0.9 m RMS. We note that the peak amplitudes at both pressure gauges and 4 of the 6 buoys are consistently well modeled. However, for two buoys, BY.IWC and BY.IWN off-shore Iwate prefecture, (Table \ref{tb_wave_stations}, Figure \ref{fig_maps}) the peak amplitude is underestimated by about 50\%. The tide gauges contribute little to the inversion since they receive the smallest weight and provide information too late to be of use for early warning for this event. We note that for two of the distant tide gauges, TI.CHO and TI.MYE, the peak amplitude is not well resolved (Figures \ref{fig_results1},\ref{fig_results2}). We also note that these two stations exhibit the strongest non-linear behavior (Figures \ref{fig_linearity1},\ref{fig_linearity2}). The tide gauge stations with small non-linear behavior and closest to the source (TI.AYU, TI.MYO and TI.OFU) appear to be well modeled, in spite of having a clipped record.

Using the slip inversions and seafloor uplift maps in Figures \ref{fig_results1} and \ref{fig_results2} we model the ensuing tsunami with GeoClaw as described in Section \ref{sec:method}. Figure \ref{fig_forecast} shows the maximum expected amplitude near the earthquake source. We note that the inversions at 157s and 10min that have little or no information from the wave gauges predict smaller amplitudes than the inversions relying on more complete wave gauge records. After 20 min a sizable tsunami is forecast in the near shore region. It is interesting to note a large lobe of high amplitude waves radiating in the trench normal direction. This lobe seems to initiate above the deeper (10-20 km) asperity in Figures \ref{fig_results1} and \ref{fig_results2} and not above the very shallow patch of high slip. At 50 minutes a second lobe of high amplitude is forecast to radiate from the very shallow patch of slip at 38$^\circ$N. The intersection of these high amplitude lobes with the coastline matches the pattern of maximum observed inundation amplitudes from the survey points (Figure \ref{fig_inundation}). For the smooth land-based models the first wave is almost continuous along the fault strike, however for the more complex models from the joint inversions the first pulse is broken into two or three distinct waves that jog along strike. There are persistent oscillations in Sendai bay and the smaller inlets of the Sanriku coast (38$^\circ$N to 40$^\circ$N) and along the continental shelf akin to basin and shelf resonance. Diffraction along the Oshika peninsula that juts north of Sendai bay is also apparent. The complex behavior in the models shows the repeated and long-lasting attack of multiple waves on the coastline after the main arrival.

Figure \ref{fig_inundation} shows the inundation computed at the coast as defined by the pre-tsunami water-land boundary for each simulation. It also shows the comparison between the inundation measured by \citet{mori2012} at the survey points and the inundation predicted by our simulations at those same survey points. The first two models at 157s and 10min show a relatively smooth distribution of expected coastal inundations between 0 and 10m. They also show a systematic under-prediction of the inundation at the survey points and only 900-950 of the 2256 survey points are inundated (Table \ref{tb_results}). The variance reduction is high for these points (80-85\%, Table \ref{tb_results}). This indicates that even though many points are not inundated, those that are inundated are accurately modeled. As noted in the slip inversion (Figure \ref{fig_results1}), at 20 min the modeled sea floor deformation increases substantially and this has a noticeable impact on the inundation. The coastal inundation is now 10-20m and 1913 of the 2256 survey points are inundated (Table \ref{tb_results}). However the comparison at the survey points shows a systematic over-estimation of the inundation. This is evidenced as well by the low variance reduction of the survey inundation (59\%). Between 30 and 50min. as the slip inversion stabilizes the inundation estimates at the coast stabilize as well. The number of inundated survey points in this time interval is reduced to ~1600 out of 2256 (Table \ref{tb_results}) and the variance reduction improves to 77\% by 50min. The majority of the survey points that are not inundated by the slip inversions lie in the Sanriku coast between 38.4$^\circ$N and 40$^\circ$N.

\section{Limitations and Implications for Warning}

We have demonstrated in Chapter 3 how precise estimates of coseismic motion from seismogeodetic data could produce slip inversions of the Tohoku-oki event in about 3 min. For tsunami early warning the inundation results computed in this work show that the smooth slip inversion computed only from land data under-predicts the tsunami. However, this estimate is available quickly (157s after rupture initiation) and is a significant improvement over the initial wave height estimates that relied on the first magnitude estimate of Mw 7.9 \citep{ozaki2011}, indicating more accurate magnitude estimation and improved depiction of the geographic extent of moment release. This result is significant for more reliable early forecasts and hazard mitigation. Furthermore, the situation rapidly improves as offshore wave gauge data are ingested into the inversion. By 20min after OT the forecast of inundation (Figures \ref{fig_forecast} and \ref{fig_inundation}) shows an acute increase in intensity that better reflects the observed inundation pattern Ð the first waves arrived at about 30min after OT. This could in an operational setting lead to a revised warning with higher predicted intensities. By 30min a solution, which can be considered final, is available and it successfully predicts most of the gross features of inundation. This is most significant for rapid response by providing an improved determination of the hardest hit areas.
As noted by \citet{arcas2012} the multiplicity of possible earthquake source models that arise by virtue of the non-uniqueness of the inversion pose a challenge to forecast and warning. The results discussed here convincingly demonstrate that in spite of this, the objectively determined slip inversions discussed herein can replicate the pattern of inundation with minimum assumptions. We have quantified the modelsÕ skill by comparing to inundation measurements. We also argue that coseismic offset estimates (land-based data only) can serve to initiate response for tsunami early warning. Additionally, and perhaps more importantly, these results demonstrate that wave gauges in relatively shallow water ($\sim$100-1000 m) can be successfully employed to determine the earthquake source and forecast the ensuing tsunami. One need not deploy the sensors in deep water to allow for successful forecast of tsunami intensity. It remains true however, that the non-linearity in tsunami propagation exists. It is manifested most strongly in shallow tide gauge stations and at longer times after the first arrival, limiting their utility. In light of this and the discussion on linearity in Section \ref{sec:linearity}, when performing a joint inversion, it would be ill-advised to use long segments of the wave gauge records after the first arrival. Furthermore, before performing a joint inversion at other locations and with other wave gauge data one must exercise due diligence and ascertain that the non-linearities are indeed small. However, that shallow water wave gauges can be used for warning is an important result. The time taken to obtain a solution that forecasts a tsunami of the observed intensity (20min) is a function of the distribution of such wave gauges. Figure \ref{fig_forecast} shows that the distribution of such stations is not optimal for observation of this particular event. It remains possible that the forecast and warning timeline will continue to diminish as such networks of sensors become denser. GPS buoys are particularly attractive. In their current mode of operation they rely on baseline positioning and are referenced to a GPS station on-shore. This limits how far off-shore they can be deployed ($\sim$20-30km) without losing accuracy and also means that if the reference station moves, as was the case with this large earthquake, then the position solution at the buoy will be degraded. However, recent advancements in precise point positioning and tightly coupled Kalman filtering with accelerometers \citep{Geng2013} show that it is possible to do away entirely with the nearby reference station and retain the same level or even improve the precision obtained with relative positioning. This makes it possible to deploy GPS buoys at arbitrarily large distances offshore only limited by telemetry considerations.

The results and analysis shown here have some limitations and it is important to understand them. In the linear inverse framework we have sacrificed some of the fit to the coseismic data (Table \ref{tb_results}) to fit the tsunami data as best we can, especially, the ocean bottom pressure and GPS buoy stations. The general pattern of coseismic deformation is still modeled and provides a valuable constraint. However, the fit to the coseismic data is reduced from 99\% variance reduction in the land-based inversion to $\sim$~70\% levels in the joint inversion. As noted by \citet{hill2012} this can be ameliorated by placing slip where the model resolution of coseismic offsets is the lowest. This effectively locates the slip in the null-space of the coseismic data and hence doesnÕt affect the data fit. We are exploring these null-space techniques and assessing their utility for real-time algorithms. Additionally, the short-wavelength along-strike features in the computed vertical deformation (Figure \ref{fig_results1}) are an artifact of the fault discretization. Very shallow subfault patches have such peaked vertical deformations that if discretization is not fine enough (our subfaults are 25x25 km) this behavior arises. This is a common problem in inversions that allow slip to go to the trench axis while keeping subfault size constant along the slab model. Given the good fits to the tsunami wave gauges we do not consider this a substantive issue for rapid computations. Future improvements to the inversion techniques might include employing irregular grids to allow for finer discretization at shallow depths. We are however interested in a speedy computation so we have chosen to keep the discretization at its current coarseness.
\citet{macinnes2013} noted that tsunami simulations from different geophysical data sets and techniques failed to capture the large inundation levels observed in the Sanriku coast between 38.4$\circ$N and 40$^\circ$N. Although we can forecast large inundation amplitudes in Sanriku we observe a similar pattern. It is noteworthy that inversions that directly employ wave measurements, like ours, fail to completely model the intricacies of the inundation. We believe that in large part this is due to limited resolution in the publicly available topography ($^\sim$90 m pixels) and bathymetry ($^\sim$1 km pixels) data sets used in this study. Consider Figure \ref{fig_TRIsanriku} where we compute the terrain ruggedness index (TRI) \citep{riley1999} of the topography/bathymetry grid. TRI is the mean difference between elevation at a pixel and its neighboring 8 pixels. The geomorphic features of the Sanriku coastline are characterized by rias, which are rugged and steep coastal inlets made from submergence of fluvial valleys. The Sanriku region has the most instances of inundation survey points that are not wetted by our simulations. 

\begin{figure}[!ht] 
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{./figures/ch5/TRIsanriku.pdf}
    \caption[TRI along the Sanriku coast]{(a) Terrain ruggedness index (TRI) of the topography/bathymetry grid used in this study. (b) Distribution of inundated and non-inundated survey points for the simulation at 50min after OT as a function of TRI.}
  \label{fig_TRIsanriku}
\end{figure}
	Figure \ref{fig_TRIsanriku}a shows that indeed this region has the largest TRI. Also of note in Figure 9\ref{fig_TRIsanriku} is that at the coastline in Sanriku the TRI drops abruptly from $\sim$30m on the landward side to 0m on the seaward side. It is unlikely that such abrupt change of geomorphology at the waterline is real; the rias should continue offshore forming significant underwater canyons. More likely is that because the bathymetric portion of the grid has a lower resolution (30 arcseconds, as opposed to 3 arcseconds onshore) it fails to resolve the jagged offshore features associated with rias. Figure \ref{fig_TRIsanriku}b shows the TRI values of the topography pixels containing the inundation survey points. It shows the TRI values for survey points that are wetted by the simulation and for those that remain dry (i.e., where the simulation fails to model an inundation) for the final run obtained with the data accrued at 50 min after OT. We can see from this plot that although the simulation inundates some of the survey points with high TRI, most of the survey points that remain dry have consistently high values of TRI. This can be best seen in Figure \ref{fig_TRIhist} where we bin the dry/wet survey points in 2.5 TRI intervals. It is clear, that with increasing terrain ruggedness, the model fit diminishes. Thus we believe that terrain complexity not captured by the grids is an important factor. One way to improve the capacity of earthquake source models to accurately forecast the inundation is to employ better quality grids in regions of high TRI. GeoClaw can easily handle this without a prohibitive increase in computation time with its adaptive mesh refinement approach, but currently such datasets are proprietary.

The blue portion of the bar represents the inundated points and the red represents the fraction that is not inundated by the simulation.}
  \label{fig_TRIhist}
\end{figure}

It is also important that early warning systems be coupled with judicious analysis of the hazard before an event occurs. For example, pre-event analyses with better bathymetry would undoubtedly show that a 10m tsunami at the mouth of a ria, as in the Sanriku coast, could be greatly amplified by the local bathymetry. Thus even if the first estimation of tsunami intensity (Figure \ref{fig_inundation}a) is an underestimate, coupling with a priori knowledge of the hazard can lead to a better response. Warning is only one part of the response system. Pre-event analysis of the hazard and societal education are just as important, and without them a warning is of little use.

Additional close inspection of the GPS buoy records (i.e. Figure \ref{fig_results2}g) shows that all models underestimate the peak tsunami amplitude at the northernmost buoys, BY.IWC and BY.IWN (Table \ref{tb_wave_stations}). This is one of the regions of higher TRI. Nearby BY.IWS and tide gauges TI.OFU and TI.MYO are well modeled although the tide gauge records are clipped and we are unable to say if maximum amplitude would have been correctly modeled. We also note that the final source model consistently places a streak of 5-10m of slip on the northern portion of the fault at around 40$^\circ$N. These two observations (the underestimate at the northern buoys and the streak of slip on the northern part of the model) imply that we cannot discard the possibility that secondary sources of tsunami energy \citep{morra2013} (i.e., submarine landslides, splay faults, etc.) are contributing to the wave records and contaminating the inversion results. Quantifying and modeling the contributions of such sources to the overall radiation pattern of the tsunami remains a challenge to early warning and tsunami science in general. It is possible that other assumptions lead to the observed discrepancy. For example GeoClaw does not consider the contribution of horizontal momentum to tsunami generation. It is possible that motion of large vertical features such as continental slopes might have an important contribution to the tsunami energy budget. Only recently has this assumption been seriously studied \citep{satake2013}. Additionally, in tsunami modeling it is customary to assume instantaneous tsunami generation. For example, for the 2004 Sumatra event it was shown that time dependent rupture models had little effect on the observed tsunami \citep{fujii2007}. However \citep{satake2013} argues that for Tohoku-oki, near-source observations are best modeled with a kinematic slip model. Part of our future research is to employ near-field broadband strong motion displacement data recorded for this event [Melgar et al., 2013a] and wave gauge data to derive kinematic models. It will be important to assess the impact of such techniques on rapid tsunami response.

The Japanese GPS network (GEONET) is very dense and its inter-station spacing an exception rather than a norm worldwide. In this study we used a sparser subset of 139 stations (the collocated GPS/accelerometer pairs) to compute the first inversion. This was done to demonstrate the capabilities of the seismogeodetic solution and also to illustrate the performance with a station distribution more akin to other regional GPS networks. We found that the sparse seismogeodetic solution is adequate and can be computed quickly but in general it underestimates the inundation. The effect of this undersampling the land-based network is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig_allgeonet} where we present the inundation predicted by the optimal inversion resulting from employing the displacement waveforms from the 816 GEONET stations in the affected region. The maximum amplitude forecast is larger than in the seismogeodetic solution alone and closer to the result from the joint inversion. The comparison with the survey points improves, 1538 out of the 2250 survey points are inundated by the full GPS network solution and variance reduction is 70\%. Not surprisingly, a denser land GPS network provides a better early forecast of the tsunami and would be further ameliorated by collocation with accelerometers at all stations. In general, the methodology described herein can be employed with GPS data alone, however we've shown that the improved vertical resolution resulting from the seismogeodetic combination improves the derived finite fault slip model. Furthermore, the prospect of real-time coseismic source modeling with corrected strong motion records alone remains elusive.

Although in this work we have focused on the immediate impact of the tsunami, i.e., the inundation, the time evolution of the models shows that there is significant structure to the tsunami even hours after origin time. This can have important impact on coastal and ship operations \citep{lynett2012}. Thus longer-range forecasts could be aided by the results discussed here.
We also note that the algorithm employed in this study relies on the traditional method of regularization to solve an ill-conditioned inverse problem. The results are encouraging and driven by the requirement of rapid computation. Inversions for 200 distinct sources at different smoothing levels takes only a few minutes on a four-core machine and are easily parallelizable since each inversion is independent of all the others. Nonetheless the issue of selecting the smoothing parameter automatically and objectively remains irksome. We have employed the statistical argument of minimizing information loss by using the ABIC. However, we foresee that as computational power increases it will become feasible to use fully probabilistic techniques to determine the earthquake source \citep{minson2013}. Such Bayesian approaches are desirable because they sample all models that are consistent with observations while restricting the ensemble to those that fit the assumptions about the underlying physics. This is preferable over solutions that require regularization or smoothing which is, in a sense, an artificial numerical restriction not strictly based on a tangible physical constraint. Such Bayesian algorithms are currently burdensome because of the large number of free parameters involved in computing the earthquake source. Recently these approaches have become more computationally tractable with better sampling techniques [Minson et al., 2013] but not yet to the degree where they can be computed immediately after the earthquake origin with ease. However, the advances are promising. In this probabilistic paradigm one can produce rapid estimates of hazard curves along the coastline \citep{gonzalez2009} instead of point estimates of inundation intensity. One could then more adequately characterize the hazard and contemplate the creation of higher-level products such as expected economic impact and rapid loss calculations similar to what the PAGER product does for earthquake shaking.

This is a rapidly evolving field. Leveraging earlier results from [Melgar et al., 2013b] we have demonstrated an end-to-end automatable methodology that minimizes operator interaction. Starting with the land-based data that are available many minutes before sea-borne measurements, we determine basic source parameters, i.e., magnitude, type of faulting and geographic extent from the line source CMT inversion. This then allows selection of appropriate fault-model geometry to launch a heterogeneous finite fault slip inversion. Once the slip inversion is computed, sea floor deformation can be calculated and used as the initial conditions for a model of the tsunami. This yields a first forecast of tsunami intensity and can be used for warning. Then, as time goes on, wave gauges information is ingested and the inversion rerun. The new updated earthquake source is used to obtain a new tsunami model and forecast. For the Tohoku-oki earthquake the first forecast is available at 157s after OT. At 20 minutes after origin time a revised forecast that has high inundation amplitudes is determined; recall maximum inundation at the closest points on the coast was not reached until 30 minutes \citep{ozaki2011}. After this time (OT+30min) the earthquake source and tsunami forecasts remain without major changes. We have proposed an indirect form of forecast and warning that is much improved because it relies partly on direct measurements of tsunami wave propagation to compute the earthquake source and not just on traditional seismological measurements.
Thus, we contend that we have demonstrated that with current geophysical sensor technology and algorithms the expectation of detailed and timely tsunami forecast and warning in the coastal areas adjacent to large earthquakes, regardless of their faulting type and location, is a realistic one.
